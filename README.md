# SmartBite

Mobile-first app that helps communities eat well within their budget. AI-generated meal planning combined with **crowd-powered grocery pricing** — every user who scans a barcode at the shelf contributes real price data that helps their whole neighbourhood save money.

> **V1 is Texas-only.** All TX grocery stores supported. Community scanning is the pricing engine — no third-party pricing APIs.

**Core value proposition:** "Band together to eat better for less."

## Scalability notes

The architecture is stateless and scales horizontally. Four targeted fixes before 10k users:

| Fix | When | Action |
|---|---|---|
| PgBouncer connection pooling | Now | Enable in Supabase dashboard, append `?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1` to `DATABASE_URL` |
| Event-driven canonical price recompute | Sprint 5 | Enqueue BullMQ job per observation — never full-table cron scan |
| PriceObservation archival | Sprint 5 | Move rows older than 90 days to archive table monthly |
| Async plan generation | Sprint 7 | Queue Claude job, return immediately, mobile polls `GET /plans/current` |

Everything else (Redis, rate limiting, tier enforcement, Prisma query safety) handles 10k+ without changes.

---

## AI model configuration

All AI model selections are centralised in `apps/api/src/lib/aiConfig.ts` and driven by environment variables — no code changes needed to swap models.

| Use case | Default model | Override env var |
|---|---|---|
| Meal plan generation | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | `AI_MODEL_MEAL_PLAN` |
| Recipe generation | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | `AI_MODEL_RECIPE_GENERATE` |
| Price suggestions | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | `AI_MODEL_PRICE_SUGGEST` |
| Reminder habit learning | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | `AI_MODEL_REMINDERS` |

Haiku is used for lightweight structured tasks (~88% cheaper than Sonnet). Sonnet is reserved for creative generation where output quality matters.

---

### Barcode product lookup pipeline (enhance in Sprint 5)
> "Scan a barcode and the product name, brand, image, and unit size are pre-filled instantly"

**Server — parallel multi-source (replacing current single-source + hard 404)**
- [ ] `src/lib/usda.ts` — USDA FoodData Central client (free API key, 3600 req/hr)
- [ ] `products.ts` — fan out OFF + USDA in parallel, merge best fields, never return 404 for a real UPC (return partial data)
- [ ] Add `nutrition`, `ingredients`, `category` fields to Item table
- [ ] Add `USDA_API_KEY` to `.env.example`

Merge strategy: OFF wins on image + brand; USDA wins on nutrition + US-specific coverage (HEB store brands, regional TX products).

**Client — AsyncStorage cache for instant repeat scans**
- [ ] `stores/productCacheStore.ts` — Zustand + AsyncStorage, 30-day TTL, max 500 items LRU
- [ ] `scanner/confirm.tsx` — check local cache first (works offline), fall back to API

Result: scanning the same item twice (e.g. eggs every week) shows product info before any network call.

---

### AI model config (cross-cutting, implement in Sprint 5)
> "Swap the AI model for any use case without touching service code"

- [x] Apply to all Sprint 5 AI services (price suggestions, reminders)
- [ ] Document override vars in `.env.example`

---

### Feedback channel (cross-cutting, implement in Sprint 6)
> "Users can report bugs, wrong prices, and request features from the app"

- [x] `Feedback` model — type (BUG|FEATURE_REQUEST|PRICE_ISSUE|GENERAL), subject, body, appVersion, platform
- [x] `POST /feedback` — authenticated, rate limited 5/hr
- [x] `FeedbackSheet` component — type picker, subject + body inputs, submit
- [x] Profile screen: "Send feedback" entry point
- [x] Scanner success: "Report wrong price" shortcut (pre-fills type=PRICE_ISSUE)

---

### Onboarding checklist + Did You Know tips (cross-cutting, implement in Sprint 5)
> "Interactive checklist drives first-week activation; tips teach advanced features at the right moment"

**Onboarding checklist (home screen card, disappears when all done)**
- [x] `completedActions String[]` field on UserProfile
- [x] `markActionComplete()` helper wired to: `PUT /profile`, `POST /plans/generate`, `POST /prices/observation`, `POST /purchases`, `POST /recipes/:id/cooked`
- [x] `OnboardingChecklist` component — progress bar, 5 action rows, auto-hides on completion
- [x] `GET /profile/checklist` route for home-screen progress refresh

**Did You Know tips (contextual, per-screen)**
- [ ] `TipBanner` component — dismissible strip with emoji + text
- [ ] AsyncStorage dismiss tracking (key: `tips_dismissed`)
- [ ] 7 contextual tips wired to: Home, Shopping list (first visit + first check-off), Pantry, Recipe detail, Rewards, Profile

---

### Announcements (cross-cutting feature, target Sprint 5)
> "Broadcast banners and modals to users without an app update"

Admin inserts rows directly into DB (no admin UI in V1). Mobile fetches on home screen mount and renders dismissible banners or one-per-session modals.

**Backend**
- [x] `Announcement` model — title, body, type (BANNER|MODAL), style (INFO|SUCCESS|WARNING|PROMO), targetTiers, ctaText, ctaDeepLink, startsAt, endsAt
- [x] `GET /announcements` — active + non-expired, filtered by user tier, Redis-cached 5min

**Mobile**
- [ ] `AnnouncementBanner` component — coloured strip, dismiss (persisted to AsyncStorage by announcement ID)
- [ ] Home screen: fetch + render banners below header
- [ ] MODAL type: shown once per cold-start session

**Use cases:** outage notices, feature launches, maintenance windows, tier-targeted promos ("Try Pro free")
