# SmartBite

Mobile-first app that helps communities eat well within their budget. AI-generated meal planning combined with **crowd-powered grocery pricing** — every user who scans a barcode at the shelf contributes real price data that helps their whole neighbourhood save money.

> **V1 is Texas-only.** All TX grocery stores supported. Community scanning is the pricing engine — no third-party pricing APIs.

**Core value proposition:** "Band together to eat better for less."

## Sprint progress

### Sprint 1 — Auth + onboarding + store discovery ✅
> "I can sign up and tell the app about myself"

**Backend**
- [x] Monorepo setup (Turborepo, Expo, Fastify, Prisma, pnpm)
- [x] Supabase project + full schema migration (all models including rewards/scanner groundwork)
- [x] Auth routes: signup, login, logout, `/auth/me`
- [x] `GET /stores/nearby` — static TX_GROCERY_STORES list (no external API)
- [x] User profile CRUD — budget, retailers (any TX stores, no cap), dietary, location

**Mobile**
- [x] Expo Router scaffold — 4 tabs, auth screens, recipe detail
- [x] Offline dependencies installed (netinfo, async-storage)
- [x] Rate limiting configured (`@fastify/rate-limit`)
- [x] Auth screens: login, signup — wired to API
- [x] Home screen empty state with "Generate plan" CTA

- [x] Loading skeleton, error state + retry
- 52 API tests + 21 mobile tests passing

---

### Sprint 3 — Grocery pricing UI ✅
> "I know exactly where to shop and what it costs"

- [x] `scanPrices` orchestrator — queries `CanonicalPrice` table (community DB); graceful "scan to unlock" when no data
- [x] Split optimizer — greedy per-ingredient, `SPLIT_THRESHOLD = $3`
- [x] `GET /prices/scan`, Redis price cache (1hr TTL)
- [x] `GET /shopping-list/:planId` — merged, deduped, sorted by store
- [x] `PriceCompareBar`, `BestStoreCard`, mode toggle, split view
- [x] Shopping list screen — grouped by store, checkable rows, progress bar
- Note: MealMe API deprecated; Kroger API built then removed — community scanning is the sole pricing source

---

### Sprint 4 — Scanner + Community Pricing + Pantry + Purchase History ✅
> "I scan items, build the community price database, manage my pantry, and the app remembers what I buy"

**Backend** — 161 tests passing

- [x] `GET /rewards/balance`, `/rewards/ledger`, `/rewards/leaderboard`, `/rewards/badges`
- [ ] `GET /community/impact` — deferred (city-level aggregate stats, Redis hourly cache)
- [ ] Canonical price recompute BullMQ job — deferred (cluster detection, outlier quarantine, corroboration)

**Mobile**
- [x] Shopping list check-off: confirmation sheet → `POST /purchases` + `POST /pantry/sync-purchase` → check off; "Last bought" badge per ingredient
- [x] Shopping list: 📷 Scan button per store group launches barcode scanner
- [x] Pantry tab — list with qty chips, add/edit Modal, delete with confirm, pull-to-refresh
- [x] Recipe detail: "Mark as Cooked" → servings picker → `POST /recipes/:id/cooked` → deduction summary card
- [x] Rewards tab — balance card, badge grid (earned/locked), leaderboard, recent activity ledger
- [x] Scanner screens (`scanner/index`, `scanner/confirm`, `scanner/success`) — `expo-camera` barcode scan → product lookup → price/qty entry → `POST /prices/observation` → Bites celebration
- [x] Tab bar: 6 tabs — Home, Explore, Pantry, Saved, Rewards, Profile
